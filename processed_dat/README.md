## What is in this folder  

* `H3N2_HA.csv`, `H3N2_NA.csv` : `.csv` files containing all non-epitope features calculated using `Features.R` for all subtrees generated using the default `getClades2()` function.     
* `H3N2_HA_processed_nonepitope.rds`, `H3N2_NA_processed_nonepitope.rds` : `.rds` files containing not just the csv files above but also labels (continuous and binary) as well as the original flutree.   
* `H3N2_HA_processed.rds` : `.rds` file containing all features joined (nonepitope, epitope, GC content and pairwise hamming distance of associated NA sequences) for all identified subtrees using the default `getClades2()` function. Structure is similar to all `*nonepitope.rds` files.   
* `HA_subtree_GC.txt`: `.txt` file generated by Pak with GC content for all subtrees. Duplicated content of `HA_hamming_gc.csv`  
* `NA_hamming_gc.csv`: `.csv` file containing min, max, median pairwise Hamming distance as well as min, max and mean GC content of NA sequences corresponding to tips of the subtrees generated from the `getClades2()` function from the HA trees.  
* `subtree_NA_tree_features.csv`: `.csv` file containing all graph-based features (similar to `Features.R`) for the NA tree keeping only tips associated with tips of the subtrees generated from the `getClades2()` function from the HA trees.
